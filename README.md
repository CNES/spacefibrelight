# Readme First
This repository includes de Ip called Spacefibrelight. It was developped by Elsys Deign under a CNES R&D program. The main objective of this IP is :
- To provide an optimized (in ressource) implementation of the spacefibre standard (ECSS-E-ST-50-11C – SpaceFibre – Very high-speed serial link )
- To be comptabible with any spacefibre IP even if spacefibrelight IP is not fully compliant with the standard
- To be operational on Xilinx edge versal (tested on VEK280 evalboard ) and also on Nanoxplore NG-Ultra NG-Ultra300 devices.
- To be opensource
- To be addaptable (that is to say, with additionnal development this IP could be fully compliant to ECSS standard)

# Getting started
The simulation environnement is based on cocotb python framework running on Questa simulator.
